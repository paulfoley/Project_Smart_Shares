npm install

npm install -g truffle

npm install truffle-contracts

you might need other things here react-router, ethereumjs, web3, sold, etc...

npm start

Once, everything is running: In another terminal run

```
testrpc
```

Take the first account/private key that shows up in the testrpc console and log into metamask as that user.

In another terminal, compile and deploy truffle

```
truffle compile
truffle migrate
```

Copy the .json file from build to sol

When you create a new shareholder, it will save to Firebase and the shareholder with the newly created Ethereum account number

You can show this from the Firebase UI to prove that we just created it

Then it will also kick off the smart contract and pop open meta mask. Don't touch the gas and just confirm the transaction.

It should complete and the shares should be transferred to the new ethereum account.

```
node
var Web3 = require("web3")
var web3 = new Web3(new Web3.providers.HttpProvider('http://localhost:8545'))
web3.eth.getBalance("0xE0EC8d2432678d40C012E290c05E9a464e85feff").then(console.log);

```
